# Command Line Chess Game
A project I had done back in 9th grade (around 2013-2014). It's missing quite some functionality, including castling (I think), single-player mode, and two-step pawn movement. The code isn't very well documented either, but whatever works.

### Instructions to run:

#### Prerequisites: 
- JDK (anything above 6 should work. I used 9 while checking if it still worked)
- A command line/IDE environment for Java. Eclipse was used for development, but I have no recollection of how to make it work now, shall be giving command line method.

#### Steps
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the repo folder. Run `javac game/chess/*.java`
3. There shouldn't be any bugs. Now run `java game.chess.RunChess`

#### How to play
The instructions are given explicitly on the screen. Line spacing is a bit screwed, I might fix that later given time.

Have fun!
